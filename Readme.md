# Yamlet

 Simplified Yaml but with include
 
## Rationale

 Yaml is often more concise than XML or JSON. Yaml could be made even simpler
 than that by omitting features. An include feature is added (see this
 [Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2278241)).
   
## Facts

 * Data types: strings, lists, mappings.
 * Planned: True Yaml subset: some interpunction will be forbidden.
 * Planned: Yamlet specification.
 * Planned: Include directives. Include directives would be parsed as a string
   by vanilla Yaml parsers.
 
## Credits

 Yamlet is very similar to
 [Isaac Schlueter's yamlish](https://github.com/isaacs/yamlish). Readers will
 recognize Isaac's coding style immediately. :-)
